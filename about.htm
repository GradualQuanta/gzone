<p><a href=http://ecosia.com/search?q=gradual+change+movement>Gradual Change Movement</a> is an umbrella for each one of us to accomplish our mission and be who we truly are.
<p>This is not a matter of politics, we are not here just for the talk, we are not another website to preach what we should do, to give us a good conscious ...
and yet nothing is done or change.

<p>
We are here to collaborate and give us the means for actions;
we federate our effort with every one on the planet.
You think alike and are in the same spirit on making our world a better place, then you part of us, our team. <a href=AHE/>Advancement of humanity effort</a> is one of our team, there are many accessible via <a href=netw/my-circle.htm>circles</a>.
<br> 
In this manner we partner with <a href=http://google.com/search?q=Earth+Nation>Earth Nation</a>
and the <a href=https://asc.ai/homecenter?affid=michel-advancement-of-humanityeffort>ASC keys Collective</a> and <a href=http://gc-bank.org>GC Bank</a> to unlock our individual potentials.

<p>We want to be practical, we ask ourselves <a href=projects.htm>what we can do</a>,
even the tiniest move is still something that bring us closer to our goal.

<p> so don't hesitate to do your part, even if you believe it won't change a thing, because in reality is always does.
We are perpetually shaping our universe
and the more we are steering it in the right direction,
the faster we will see changes.

<p>We all have <a href=/cgi-bin/videoclip.pl?list=talents>talents</a> ... explore yours with us (register with <a href=http://talunc.neocities.org/>TalUnc</a>).
